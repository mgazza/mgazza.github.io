[{"categories":null,"contents":"Introduction\nIf you’ve spent any time working with Kubernetes, you’ve probably heard of GitOps -a methodology that treats Git as the source of truth for defining and operating infrastructure and applications. In this post, I’ll walk you through a GitOps setup that uses a hierarchical folder structure, combining Helm, Helmfile, and Kustomize to give you robust, testable, and scalable deployments. We’ll also see how tools like Flux and Tilt fit into the workflow, enabling both automated deployments and seamless local development.\nWhy GitOps? Before we dive into the specifics, let’s revisit what GitOps brings to the table:\nVersion Control: Every change to your Kubernetes configurations is committed to Git, providing an audit trail and easy rollbacks. Single Source of Truth: Teams can rely on the repo as the canonical description of what’s running in each cluster. Automation: Changes in Git trigger updates to your clusters, reducing manual operations and ensuring consistency. This post assumes you\u0026rsquo;re already sold on GitOps and are looking for a tangible organisational pattern. Let\u0026rsquo;s jump in.\nThe Repository Structure Our GitOps repository is divided into four main folders -plus a special src directory for source code and a Tiltfile for local dev. Here’s a quick overview:\n. ├── helm-charts ├── components ├── groups ├── clusters ├── src └── Tiltfile 1. Helm Charts Purpose: This directory stores all Helm charts -whether first-party or third-party dependencies -that form the foundation of your Kubernetes services. Workflow: Render: Helm charts are templated to disk. Include in Kustomize: You use Kustomize to ingest those templates. Manage with Helmfile: Helmfile can orchestrate multiple Helm releases, ensuring everything is installed/updated consistently. This approach decouples the raw Helm charts from the environment-specific overlays, making it easier to plug them into different clusters in a standardized way.\n2. Components Purpose: Store Kubernetes manifests that are not part of Helm charts. This could include CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions), operator manifests, or any other resources you want to keep separate. Usage: Directly reference these components in your cluster definitions or in a higher-level grouping concept (more on that next). 3. Groups Purpose: Group related services and configurations together under a single overlay. For example, a monitoring group might include Prometheus, Grafana, and other supporting components. Hierarchy: Groups can reference other groups, enabling layering. A dev group might inherit from a default group, adding environment-specific patches for development clusters (e.g., less resource allocation, debug logging). 4. Clusters Purpose: Each cluster folder describes exactly what should be running on that cluster, pulling in components and groups as needed. Structure: Each cluster has its own folder, which Flux (or another GitOps tool like Argo CD) monitors. Subfolders often map to namespaces or functional areas. Environment-specific customisations, such as image overrides or domain-specific settings, also live here. Benefits: This design ensures that each cluster references only the resources it needs, with any environment-specific overrides captured in a single place. 5. src (Git Submodules) Purpose: Each application or service your team develops has its own dedicated repo, added to this GitOps repo as a submodule. Motivation: Separating source code lifecycles from infrastructure while still keeping them in close proximity. Each service can evolve at its own pace (with separate versioning and pull requests). When you’re ready to deploy, you update references in the GitOps repo to point to the correct version or commit. 6. Tilt for Local Development Tiltfile: A single Tiltfile at the root of your GitOps repo configures local Kubernetes development using Tilt and k3d. Realtime Feedback: Tilt builds Docker images locally as you code and pushes them into your k3d cluster. You can check out feature branches across multiple submodules and test them all together in a local environment. Developer Happiness: This local dev approach drastically shortens the feedback loop, letting you iterate faster than if you had to push and wait for a remote pipeline to run. CI/CD Flow Now that we’ve broken down the structure, let’s see how changes flow from a developer’s pull request to a cluster.\n1. Pull Request → Image Build Trigger: A developer creates or updates a pull request in the src project repository. Automation: A CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) builds a Docker image for the new code. 2. CI Environment Setup in Dev Cluster The pipeline references the GitOps repo (specifically the Dev cluster folder). A CI folder under that Dev cluster is used to stand up a temporary environment for tests. This CI folder typically isn’t referenced by the main Dev cluster overlay, so it doesn’t affect production-like resources. The pipeline applies a Kustomization overlay that includes the new Docker image (and possibly “latest” versions of other services). 3. Readiness \u0026amp; Integration Tests Wait for Ready: The pipeline checks that all pods in the CI environment reach a “Ready” state. Integration Tests: Another folder within the CI path (e.g., integration-test) includes job manifests that run your test suite. The pipeline applies these manifests, waits for the jobs to complete, then collects logs/results. 4. Cleanup Once tests finish, the pipeline tears down the temporary namespace to keep clusters clean. If tests pass, the pipeline can merge the pull request or notify that the new image is ready for promotion. Key Benefits Modular \u0026amp; Extensible: By separating Helm charts, components, groups, and clusters, you can easily add new resources or reuse existing ones. Consistent Environments: Groups let you define and share sets of configurations across multiple stages (e.g., dev, staging, prod). Automated Testing: The CI process ensures each new feature or fix is validated in an ephemeral environment, mirroring production as closely as you need. Local Development: Tilt and k3d let you replicate the cluster environment on your machine, enabling quicker feedback loops and more productive debugging. Auditability \u0026amp; Traceability: Since every change is committed to Git, you get a clear history of who changed what and when. The Single Pane of Glass Beyond the technical benefits, this pattern fundamentally changes how teams collaborate.\nOne entry point, any role. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a backend engineer, frontend dev, SRE, or even a PM wanting to understand the system - you clone one repo and run tilt up. Within minutes you have a working https://localhost.company.co/ with the entire stack running locally.\nCross-functional debugging. I\u0026rsquo;ve watched frontend engineers fix backend bugs by running grep -r \u0026quot;error message\u0026quot; from the repo root. The pseudo mono-repo structure means the answer is always somewhere in your checkout - you just need to find it.\nNo onboarding tax. Switching teams doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean spending a week setting up a new development environment. The same tilt up command works whether you\u0026rsquo;re on payments, auth, or the data pipeline.\nDeclarative infrastructure as documentation. New joiners can understand the entire system topology by reading the clusters/ and groups/ directories. The infrastructure is the documentation.\nConclusion Adopting GitOps with a well-thought-out repository structure can dramatically simplify your Kubernetes workflows. By combining Helm, Helmfile, Kustomize, and tools like Flux or Argo CD, you can create modular, scalable, and testable deployments. And with a local development pipeline powered by Tilt and k3d, you can iterate quickly without sacrificing best practices.\nIf you’re looking for a GitOps pattern that balances clarity, flexibility, and collaboration, give this structure a try. You’ll enjoy:\nFewer manual steps. A predictable CI process. An environment that’s friendly for both new and experienced team members. Ready to dive deeper? Experiment with a small cluster or side project first. Once you’re comfortable with the structure, scale it up to your full production workloads.

In my view, this is already too late and goes against GitOps principles. How can Git be the source of truth if there are extra steps between merge and understanding impact?\nIn this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to generate manifest diffs during PR review, so reviewers see exactly what will change in the cluster before they approve.\nThe Problem Consider the typical Argo CD diff plugin workflow:\nDeveloper creates PR Reviewer approves (without seeing cluster impact) Code merges Now you see the diff of what will change Sync happens The diff comes too late. The reviewer has already approved. If something looks wrong, you need another PR to fix it.\nGitOps should mean: what\u0026rsquo;s in Git is what\u0026rsquo;s in the cluster. Reviewers should understand the full impact before approving.\nThe Solution Generate diffs at PR time by:\nBuilding manifests from the main branch Building manifests from the PR branch Diffing the two Posting the result as an artifact or comment This way, reviewers see the actual Kubernetes resources that will change - deployments, services, configmaps, everything.\nKey Principle: Absorb Your Helm Charts Before we can diff manifests, we need actual manifests to diff. If you\u0026rsquo;re deploying Helm charts directly via helm install, you don\u0026rsquo;t have rendered manifests in Git.\nInstead, absorb them:\nhelm template my-release my-chart \\ --namespace my-namespace \\ \u0026gt; components/my-service/manifests.yaml Or better, use Helmfile to declaratively manage this:\n# helmfile.yaml - keep charts vanilla, use inline values only releases: - name: prometheus namespace: monitoring chart: prometheus-community/prometheus version: 25.0.0 # Minimal inline values - external values files don\u0026#39;t work with template Then render to disk:\nhelmfile template \u0026gt; components/monitoring/prometheus.yaml Important: Keep absorbed charts as vanilla as possible. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to configure everything via Helm values. Instead, push customisation to Kustomize overlays where changes are visible and diffable:\n# groups/monitoring/kustomization.yaml resources: - ../../components/monitoring/prometheus.yaml patches: - patch: |- - op: replace path: /spec/replicas value: 3 target: kind: Deployment name: prometheus-server This separation means:\nComponents: Vanilla absorbed charts (rarely change) Groups/Clusters: Environment-specific patches (visible in diffs) Building and Diffing The core CI logic is straightforward:\n# Build manifests from main branch git checkout origin/main kustomize build clusters/prod \u0026gt; /tmp/main-manifests.yaml # Build manifests from PR branch git checkout $PR_BRANCH kustomize build clusters/prod \u0026gt; /tmp/pr-manifests.yaml # Generate diff diff -u /tmp/main-manifests.yaml /tmp/pr-manifests.yaml \u0026gt; diff.txt For multiple clusters or kustomization roots, iterate:\nfor root in clusters/*/; do cluster=$(basename $root) kustomize build $root \u0026gt; /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml # ... diff each done GitLab CI Example generate-diffs: rules: - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID changes: - deployments/**/* script: | # Fetch main branch git fetch origin main # Build main branch manifests git checkout origin/main for root in clusters/*/; do cluster=$(basename $root) kustomize build $root \u0026gt; /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml done # Build PR branch manifests git checkout $CI_COMMIT_SHA for root in clusters/*/; do cluster=$(basename $root) kustomize build $root \u0026gt; /tmp/pr-$cluster.yaml diff -u /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml /tmp/pr-$cluster.yaml \u0026gt; diffs/$cluster.diff || true done artifacts: paths: - diffs/ when: always GitHub Actions Example name: Generate Manifest Diffs on: pull_request: paths: - \u0026#39;clusters/**\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;components/**\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;groups/**\u0026#39; jobs: diff: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: fetch-depth: 0 - name: Setup Kustomize uses: imranismail/setup-kustomize@v2 - name: Generate diffs run: | mkdir -p diffs for root in clusters/*/; do cluster=$(basename $root) # Build from main git checkout origin/main kustomize build $root \u0026gt; /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml 2\u0026gt;/dev/null || echo \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml # Build from PR git checkout ${{ github.sha }} kustomize build $root \u0026gt; /tmp/pr-$cluster.yaml # Diff diff -u /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml /tmp/pr-$cluster.yaml \u0026gt; diffs/$cluster.diff || true done - name: Upload diffs uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 with: name: manifest-diffs path: diffs/ - name: Comment on PR uses: actions/github-script@v7 with: script: | const fs = require(\u0026#39;fs\u0026#39;); const diffs = fs.readdirSync(\u0026#39;diffs\u0026#39;); let comment = \u0026#39;## Manifest Diffs\\n\\n\u0026#39;; for (const file of diffs) { const content = fs.readFileSync(`diffs/${file}`, \u0026#39;utf8\u0026#39;); if (content.trim()) { comment += `\u0026lt;details\u0026gt;\u0026lt;summary\u0026gt;${file}\u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\`\\`\\`diff\\n${content}\\n\\`\\`\\`\\n\u0026lt;/details\u0026gt;\\n\\n`; } } github.rest.issues.createComment({ owner: context.repo.owner, repo: context.repo.repo, issue_number: context.issue.number, body: comment }); Finding Kustomization Roots In simple setups (one kustomization per cluster), iterating clusters/*/ works fine. But in more complex setups with nested kustomizations, groups referencing groups, and shared components, you need to find the roots - kustomizations that aren\u0026rsquo;t referenced by any other kustomization.\nThe algorithm:\nWalk all kustomization.yaml files, mark each as a potential root For each one, look at its resources and bases Any kustomization that\u0026rsquo;s referenced by another gets marked as NOT a root What remains are true roots Here\u0026rsquo;s a bash implementation:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash # find-kustomize-roots.sh - Find kustomizations not referenced by others declare -A is_root # Find all kustomization.yaml files and mark as potential roots while IFS= read -r kfile; do is_root[\u0026#34;$kfile\u0026#34;]=1 done \u0026lt; \u0026lt;(find . -name \u0026#34;kustomization.yaml\u0026#34;) # For each kustomization, mark its references as non-roots for kfile in \u0026#34;${!is_root[@]}\u0026#34;; do dir=$(dirname \u0026#34;$kfile\u0026#34;) # Extract resources and bases from the kustomization refs=$(yq -r \u0026#39;(.resources // []) + (.bases // []) | .[]\u0026#39; \u0026#34;$kfile\u0026#34; 2\u0026gt;/dev/null) for ref in $refs; do # Resolve the referenced kustomization path ref_kustomize=$(realpath -m \u0026#34;$dir/$ref/kustomization.yaml\u0026#34; 2\u0026gt;/dev/null) ref_kustomize=\u0026#34;.${ref_kustomize#$(pwd)}\u0026#34; if [[ -f \u0026#34;$ref_kustomize\u0026#34; ]]; then is_root[\u0026#34;$ref_kustomize\u0026#34;]=0 fi done done # Output only the roots for kfile in \u0026#34;${!is_root[@]}\u0026#34;; do if [[ \u0026#34;${is_root[$kfile]}\u0026#34; == \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; ]]; then echo \u0026#34;$kfile\u0026#34; fi done Now your diff script becomes:\n# Build and diff only root kustomizations for root in $(./find-kustomize-roots.sh); do root_dir=$(dirname \u0026#34;$root\u0026#34;) name=$(echo \u0026#34;$root_dir\u0026#34; | tr \u0026#39;/\u0026#39; \u0026#39;-\u0026#39;) git checkout origin/main kustomize build \u0026#34;$root_dir\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /tmp/main-$name.yaml git checkout $PR_BRANCH kustomize build \u0026#34;$root_dir\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /tmp/pr-$name.yaml diff -u /tmp/main-$name.yaml /tmp/pr-$name.yaml \u0026gt; diffs/$name.diff || true done This ensures you diff what actually gets deployed, not intermediate layers that are only used as building blocks.\nMaking It Visual Plain diffs work, but an HTML visualization makes review easier:\nTree view of changed files/resources Side-by-side comparison Kubernetes metadata (kind, namespace, name) Collapsible sections for large changes You can build this with Go templates, React, or even a simple script that wraps diff2html.\nKey Benefits No Surprises: Reviewers see exactly what will change before approving Git Is Truth: The merged state is the deployed state - no extra steps Faster Reviews: Clear diffs mean faster, more confident approvals Catch Mistakes Early: Spot accidental changes (wrong image tag, missing resource limits) before they hit the cluster Audit Trail: Diffs become part of the PR history Conclusion Showing diffs at deployment time is too late. By the time you see the impact, the code is already merged. True GitOps means understanding the full impact during review.\nThe pattern is simple:\nAbsorb Helm charts into your repo as vanilla rendered manifests Kustomize via Kustomize overlays (not Helm values) Build kustomize roots for both branches Diff and present to reviewers Review with full knowledge of cluster impact This approach has saved me countless \u0026ldquo;oops\u0026rdquo; moments and makes PR reviews genuinely meaningful for infrastructure changes.\nFurther Reading\nPractical GitOps Pattern - Repository structure and workflow Kustomize Helmfile diff2html - For visual diff rendering ","date":"January 14, 2025","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"/posts/gitops-pr-diffs/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\nA common pattern I see promoted is using tools that show you what will change in your cluster \u003cem\u003eat sync time\u003c/em\u003e - after your code is already merged.
