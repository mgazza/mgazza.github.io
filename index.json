[{"categories":["Engineering"],"contents":"Last week I open-sourced the eBPF BNG itself. The response was great, but the most common question was: \u0026ldquo;How do I actually run this thing?\u0026rdquo;\nFair question. The BNG repo has a Dockerfile and some example configs, but spinning up a distributed system with multiple components, observability, and realistic test traffic isn\u0026rsquo;t trivial. That\u0026rsquo;s the hard part of infrastructure - not writing the code, but figuring out how to deploy it, test it, and debug it when things break.\nSo this week I\u0026rsquo;m open-sourcing the infrastructure repo: bng-edge-infra. One command gets you a complete eBPF BNG stack running locally.\nThe Problem: \u0026ldquo;Works On My Machine\u0026rdquo; Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Scale When I was building the BNG, I spent more time on deployment tooling than I\u0026rsquo;d like to admit. The challenges:\nMultiple components with dependencies - BNG needs Nexus for IP allocation. Nexus nodes need to discover each other. Everything needs networking configured correctly.\nNo hardware to test on - Real OLTs cost thousands. You can\u0026rsquo;t ask contributors to buy one to test a PR.\nDistributed systems are hard to debug - When a DHCP request fails, is it the eBPF program? The userspace fallback? Nexus? Network policy? You need visibility.\nThe \u0026ldquo;getting started\u0026rdquo; cliff - Vendor docs assume you already understand the system. They show you config snippets, not working examples.\nThe solution: a GitOps repo that codifies everything - from cluster creation to traffic testing - in a reproducible, one-command experience.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s In The Repo bng-edge-infra/ ├── clusters/ │ ├── local-dev/ # k3d cluster config │ ├── staging/ # Staging Flux manifests │ └── production/ # Production Flux manifests ├── components/ │ ├── bng/ # BNG Kubernetes manifests │ ├── nexus/ # Nexus Kubernetes manifests │ └── bngblaster/ # Traffic generator ├── charts/ # Generated Helm templates ├── scripts/ │ ├── helmfile.yaml # Infrastructure definitions │ └── hydrate.sh # Manifest generation ├── src/ │ ├── bng/ # SUBMODULE: BNG source │ └── nexus/ # SUBMODULE: Nexus source └── Tiltfile # The magic The key insight is treating the entire deployment experience as code. Not just the Kubernetes manifests, but the cluster creation, the Helm chart hydration, the port forwarding, and the test harnesses.\nFour Demo Configurations The repo ships with four progressively complex deployment modes. Each one teaches you something different about the architecture:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Demo A: Standalone BNG │ │ ┌─────────┐ │ │ │ BNG │ ← Single BNG, local IP pool, no external deps │ │ └─────────┘ │ │ Good for: Understanding BNG internals, eBPF debugging │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Demo B: Single Integration │ │ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ │ │ │ Nexus │ ←──→ │ BNG │ ← BNG gets IPs from Nexus │ │ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ │ │ Good for: Testing the integration, API exploration │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Demo C: Nexus P2P Cluster │ │ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ │ │ │ Nexus-0 │ ↔ │ Nexus-1 │ ↔ │ Nexus-2 │ ← CRDT sync via mDNS │ │ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ │ │ Good for: Testing distributed state, partition tolerance │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Demo D: Full Distributed │ │ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ │ │ │ Nexus-0 │ ↔ │ Nexus-1 │ ↔ │ Nexus-2 │ │ │ └────┬────┘ └────┬────┘ └────┬────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────┬──────┴──────┬──────┘ │ │ ▼ ▼ │ │ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ │ │ │ BNG-0 │ │ BNG-1 │ ← Multiple BNGs, shared state │ │ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ │ │ Good for: Production-like testing, HA validation │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ You can run any specific demo or all of them at once:\ntilt up # All demos tilt up -- --demo=a # Just standalone BNG tilt up -- --demo=d # Just full distributed The One-Command Experience Prerequisites You need Docker and about 8GB of RAM. Then install the tools:\nmacOS:\nbrew install k3d kubectl tilt-dev/tap/tilt helmfile helm Linux:\n# k3d curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash # kubectl curl -LO \u0026#34;https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl\u0026#34; chmod +x kubectl \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/ # tilt curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tilt-dev/tilt/master/scripts/install.sh | bash # helm + helmfile curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash # helmfile from GitHub releases or brew Clone and Run git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:codelaboratoryltd/bng-edge-infra.git cd bng-edge-infra tilt up That\u0026rsquo;s it. Go make a coffee.\nWhat Happens Under The Hood When you run tilt up, here\u0026rsquo;s what happens:\nk3d cluster creation - A local Kubernetes cluster named bng-edge spins up with Flannel disabled (we\u0026rsquo;ll use Cilium instead).\nHelmfile hydration - Infrastructure charts (Cilium, Prometheus, Grafana) are templated and applied.\nDocker builds - BNG and Nexus images are built from the submodules with live reload enabled.\nNamespace creation - Each demo gets its own namespace (demo-standalone, demo-single, demo-p2p, demo-distributed).\nWorkload deployment - Deployments and StatefulSets are created with appropriate configurations.\nPort forwarding - Services are exposed to localhost automatically.\nAfter a few minutes, you\u0026rsquo;ll have:\nService URL Tilt UI http://localhost:10350 BNG API (Demo A) http://localhost:8080 Nexus API (Demo B) http://localhost:9001 BNG API (Demo D) http://localhost:8083 Hubble UI http://localhost:12000 Prometheus http://localhost:9090 Grafana http://localhost:3000 Testing Without Real Hardware One of the biggest challenges with BNG development is that you normally need real subscriber hardware to generate DHCP/PPPoE traffic. We solve this with built-in test harnesses.\nVerification Buttons Each demo has a \u0026ldquo;verify\u0026rdquo; button in the Tilt UI. Click it to run a quick health check:\nDemo A: Queries the BNG sessions API Demo B: Creates a pool in Nexus, allocates an IP, verifies the integration Demo C: Creates a pool on Nexus-0, waits for CRDT sync, verifies it appears on Nexus-1 Demo D: Full integration test across the distributed cluster BNG Blaster For serious traffic testing, we include BNG Blaster - an open-source traffic generator designed for BNG testing:\ntilt up -- --demo=blaster This gives you pre-configured test scenarios:\nIPoE session establishment PPPoE session establishment DHCP stress testing Realistic DHCP Testing For quick DHCP validation without BNG Blaster\u0026rsquo;s complexity, there\u0026rsquo;s a lightweight test harness:\ntilt up -- --demo=blaster-test This spins up a BNG with a sidecar container that can generate real DHCP traffic over a veth pair. The Tilt UI has buttons for:\nSingle DHCP request - One udhcpc request to verify basic functionality Stress test - 10 virtual clients requesting IPs concurrently Check sessions - Query the BNG API to see allocated sessions Example output from the stress test:\n=== Multi-Client DHCP Stress Test === Creating 10 virtual clients... Running DHCP requests... Client 1: 10.100.0.2/24 Client 2: 10.100.0.3/24 Client 3: 10.100.0.4/24 ... === Results === Successful: 10 / 10 Failed: 0 Duration: 3s Rate: 3 sessions/sec Observability Built In Debugging distributed systems without observability is misery. The repo comes with a full stack pre-configured.\nCilium + Hubble We use Cilium as the CNI instead of the default Flannel. This gives us:\neBPF-based networking - Fitting, given the BNG itself uses eBPF Network policies - If you want to test isolation Hubble - Real-time network flow visibility The Hubble UI (http://localhost:12000) shows you every packet flowing through the cluster. When a DHCP request fails, you can see exactly where it got dropped.\n# Or use the CLI hubble observe --namespace demo-distributed hubble observe --protocol udp --port 67 # DHCP traffic only Prometheus + Grafana Both BNG and Nexus export Prometheus metrics. The repo includes:\nPre-configured scrape configs Basic dashboards for BNG session counts, DHCP latency, Nexus allocation rates Grafana is available at http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin).\nWhy This Matters When you\u0026rsquo;re debugging \u0026ldquo;DHCP isn\u0026rsquo;t working\u0026rdquo;, the question is always where in the stack it\u0026rsquo;s failing:\nIs the packet reaching the BNG pod? → Hubble Is the eBPF fast path matching? → BNG metrics (dhcp_fastpath_hits) Is the slow path timing out on Nexus? → Nexus metrics + traces Is the response getting back to the client? → Hubble again Having all of this in one place, with one command, makes the difference between debugging for hours and debugging for minutes.\nTaking It To Production The local-dev setup is designed for experimentation, but the repo structure supports real deployments.\nStaging and Production Clusters The clusters/staging/ and clusters/production/ directories are set up for FluxCD:\nclusters/ ├── local-dev/ │ └── k3d-config.yaml ├── staging/ │ ├── flux-system/ # Flux bootstrap │ ├── infrastructure/ # Cilium, monitoring │ └── apps/ # BNG, Nexus └── production/ ├── flux-system/ ├── infrastructure/ └── apps/ Point Flux at the appropriate directory, and it\u0026rsquo;ll keep your cluster in sync with Git. The same manifests that work locally work in production - that\u0026rsquo;s the point of GitOps.\nExtending For Your Deployment The demo configurations are intentionally simple. For a real deployment, you\u0026rsquo;d add:\nRADIUS integration - The BNG supports FreeRADIUS. Add your RADIUS server config. Real IP pools - Replace the 10.x.x.x demo pools with your actual allocations. TLS everywhere - The demos use HTTP for simplicity. Production should use mTLS. Persistent storage - Nexus supports persistent state. Configure a StorageClass. Network interfaces - The demos use standard CNI networking. Real OLTs need interface configuration for subscriber-facing ports. The Bigger Picture This repo represents a philosophy: infrastructure should be runnable by anyone.\nToo often, infrastructure projects assume you\u0026rsquo;ll figure out deployment yourself. They give you a binary and some config flags and wish you luck. That\u0026rsquo;s fine for simple tools, but distributed systems are different. The deployment is the product.\nBy open-sourcing not just the BNG code but the entire deployment experience, we\u0026rsquo;re saying: this is how we think it should work. Clone it, run it, break it, improve it.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re building ISP infrastructure, evaluating the architecture, or just curious about GitOps patterns for edge systems - this is your starting point.\nTry it:\ngit clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:codelaboratoryltd/bng-edge-infra.git cd bng-edge-infra tilt up Links:\nbng-edge-infra - This repo bng - The eBPF BNG itself nexus - Distributed coordination service Questions?

The company didn\u0026rsquo;t make it, but the problems we were trying to solve stuck with me. So I spent a few weeks building what we never got to: an open-source, eBPF-accelerated BNG that runs directly on OLT hardware.\nThis post explains the architecture and why I think it\u0026rsquo;s the future of ISP edge infrastructure.\nThe Problem: Centralised BNG is a Bottleneck Traditional ISP architecture looks like this:\nCustomer → ONT → OLT → [BNG Appliance] → Internet ↑ Single point of failure Expensive proprietary hardware All subscriber traffic flows through here Every subscriber\u0026rsquo;s traffic - DHCP, authentication, NAT, QoS - flows through a central BNG appliance. These boxes cost six figures, require vendor support contracts, and create a single point of failure. When they go down, everyone goes down.\nThe industry\u0026rsquo;s answer has been to buy bigger boxes with more redundancy. But what if we flipped the model entirely?\nThe Idea: Distribute the BNG to the Edge What if, instead of funneling all traffic through a central appliance, we ran BNG functions directly on the OLT hardware at each edge site?\nCustomer → ONT → OLT(+BNG) → Internet ↑ Subscriber traffic stays LOCAL No central bottleneck Each site operates independently This isn\u0026rsquo;t a new idea - it\u0026rsquo;s essentially what hyperscalers do with their edge infrastructure. But ISPs have been slow to adopt it because:\nTraditional BNG software assumes a central deployment State management (IP allocations, sessions) is hard to distribute Performance requirements seemed to need specialised hardware The key insight is that modern Linux with eBPF/XDP can handle ISP-scale packet processing on commodity hardware.\nWhy eBPF/XDP, Not VPP? When I started this project, I evaluated two approaches:\nVPP (Vector Packet Processing) - The industry darling for high-performance networking. Used in production by big telcos. Handles 100+ Gbps easily.\neBPF/XDP - Linux kernel\u0026rsquo;s programmable packet processing. Lower peak throughput, but much simpler operations.\nFor edge deployment (10-40 Gbps per OLT), I chose eBPF/XDP:\nAspect eBPF/XDP VPP Performance 10-40 Gbps ✓ 100+ Gbps (overkill) Deployment Standard Linux kernel DPDK, hugepages, dedicated NICs Operations systemd service Complex dedicated setup Debugging tcpdump, bpftool, perf Custom tools Learning curve Steep but well-documented Very steep, less documentation VPP is the right choice for core aggregation. But for edge sites? eBPF/XDP is simpler and sufficient.\nThe Architecture Here\u0026rsquo;s what I built:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ CENTRAL (Kubernetes) │ │ Nexus: CRDT state sync, hashring IP allocation │ │ (Control plane only - NO subscriber traffic) │ └──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘ │ Config sync, metrics ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐ ▼ ▼ ▼ ┌───────────┐ ┌───────────┐ ┌───────────┐ │ OLT-BNG 1 │ │ OLT-BNG 2 │ │ OLT-BNG N │ │ eBPF/XDP │ │ eBPF/XDP │ │ eBPF/XDP │ │ 1500 subs │ │ 2000 subs │ │ 1800 subs │ └─────┬─────┘ └─────┬─────┘ └─────┬─────┘ │ │ │ Traffic LOCAL Traffic LOCAL Traffic LOCAL ↓ ↓ ↓ ISP PE ISP PE ISP PE Key principle: Subscriber traffic never touches central infrastructure. The central Nexus server only handles control plane operations - config distribution, IP allocation coordination, monitoring.\nTwo-Tier DHCP: Fast Path + Slow Path The performance-critical insight is that most DHCP operations are renewals from known subscribers. We can handle these entirely in the kernel:\nDHCP Request arrives │ ▼ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ XDP Fast Path (Kernel) │ │ │ │ 1. Parse Ethernet → IP → UDP → DHCP │ │ 2. Extract client MAC │ │ 3. Lookup MAC in eBPF subscriber_pools map │ │ │ │ CACHE HIT? │ │ ├─ YES: Generate DHCP ACK in kernel │ │ │ Return XDP_TX (~10μs latency) │ │ └─ NO: Return XDP_PASS → userspace │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ XDP_PASS (cache miss) ▼ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Go Slow Path (Userspace) │ │ │ │ 1. Lookup subscriber in Nexus cache │ │ 2. Get pre-allocated IP from subscriber record │ │ 3. Update eBPF cache for future fast path hits │ │ 4. Send DHCP response │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Results:\nFast path: ~10μs latency, 45,000+ requests/sec Slow path: ~10ms latency, 5,000 requests/sec Cache hit rate after warmup: \u0026gt;95% IP Allocation: Hashring at RADIUS Time Here\u0026rsquo;s a design decision that simplified everything: IP allocation happens at RADIUS authentication time, not DHCP time.\n1. Subscriber authenticates via RADIUS 2. RADIUS success → Nexus allocates IP from hashring (deterministic) 3. IP stored in subscriber record 4. DHCP is just a READ operation (lookup pre-allocated IP) This means:\nNo IP conflicts between distributed BNG nodes DHCP fast path can run entirely in eBPF (no userspace allocation decisions) Subscribers get the same IP every time (hashring determinism) Offline-First Edge Operation What happens when an edge site loses connectivity to central Nexus?\nKeeps working:\nExisting subscriber sessions (cached in eBPF maps) DHCP lease renewals NAT translations QoS enforcement Degraded:\nNew subscriber authentication (no RADIUS) New IP allocations (falls back to local pool) Config updates (queued until reconnect) The edge sites are designed to be autonomous. Central coordination is nice to have, not required.\nThe Implementation The BNG is a single Go binary with embedded eBPF programs:\nbng/ ├── cmd/bng/ # Main binary ├── pkg/ │ ├── ebpf/ # eBPF loader and map management │ ├── dhcp/ # DHCP slow path server │ ├── nexus/ # Central coordination client │ ├── radius/ # RADIUS client │ ├── qos/ # QoS/rate limiting │ ├── nat/ # NAT44/CGNAT │ ├── pppoe/ # PPPoE server │ ├── routing/ # BGP/FRR integration │ └── metrics/ # Prometheus metrics ├── bpf/ │ ├── dhcp_fastpath.c # XDP DHCP fast path │ ├── qos_ratelimit.c # TC QoS eBPF │ ├── nat44.c # TC NAT eBPF │ └── antispoof.c # TC anti-spoofing Running it:\n# Standalone mode (local IP pool) sudo ./bng run \\ --interface eth1 \\ --pool-network 10.0.1.0/24 \\ --pool-gateway 10.0.1.1 # Production mode (with Nexus coordination) sudo ./bng run \\ --interface eth1 \\ --nexus-url http://nexus.internal:9000 \\ --radius-enabled \\ --radius-servers radius.isp.com:1812 Hardware: White-Box OLTs This runs on any Linux box with a modern kernel (5.10+), but the target is white-box OLTs like the Radisys RLT-1600G:\n16 GPON/XGS-PON ports Runs Debian Linux ~$7,400 USD (vs six figures for traditional BNG) 1,500-2,000 subscribers per unit The same approach works with any OLT that runs Linux and exposes its network interfaces to the OS.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next The code is working but not production-ready. Missing pieces:\nDevice authentication - TPM attestation or similar to prevent rogue OLT-BNG devices IPv6 support - DHCPv6 and SLAAC Full RADIUS accounting - Currently basic Management UI - Currently CLI and Prometheus metrics only I\u0026rsquo;m considering open-sourcing the entire thing. The BNG market is dominated by expensive proprietary solutions, and there\u0026rsquo;s no good open-source alternative. Maybe there should be.\nThe Bigger Picture Traditional ISP infrastructure was designed when compute was expensive and networks were slow. Centralised appliances made sense when you needed specialised hardware for packet processing.\nBut compute is cheap now, and eBPF lets us do packet processing in the Linux kernel at line rate. The economics have shifted - it\u0026rsquo;s now cheaper to distribute the BNG to hundreds of edge sites than to build a few massive central boxes.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t just about saving money. Distributed architecture is more resilient (no single point of failure), lower latency (traffic stays local), and operationally simpler (it\u0026rsquo;s just Linux).\nThe hyperscalers figured this out years ago. ISPs are slowly catching up.\nInterested in this approach? The code is at github.com/codelaboratoryltd/bng and github.com/codelaboratoryltd/nexus. I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from anyone working on similar problems in the ISP/altnet space.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re building ISP infrastructure and want to chat about eBPF, distributed systems, or why vendor BNG appliances are a racket, reach out.\n","date":"January 16, 2026","hero":"/posts/ebpf-bng/hero.png","permalink":"/posts/ebpf-bng/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI used to work for an ISP startup that was building next-generation infrastructure.

In this post, I’ll walk you through a GitOps setup that uses a hierarchical folder structure, combining Helm, Helmfile, and Kustomize to give you robust, testable, and scalable deployments. We’ll also see how tools like Flux and Tilt fit into the workflow, enabling both automated deployments and seamless local development.\nWhy GitOps? Before we dive into the specifics, let’s revisit what GitOps brings to the table:\nVersion Control: Every change to your Kubernetes configurations is committed to Git, providing an audit trail and easy rollbacks. Single Source of Truth: Teams can rely on the repo as the canonical description of what’s running in each cluster. Automation: Changes in Git trigger updates to your clusters, reducing manual operations and ensuring consistency. This post assumes you\u0026rsquo;re already sold on GitOps and are looking for a tangible organisational pattern. Let\u0026rsquo;s jump in.\nThe Repository Structure Our GitOps repository is divided into four main folders -plus a special src directory for source code and a Tiltfile for local dev. Here’s a quick overview:\n. ├── helm-charts ├── components ├── groups ├── clusters ├── src └── Tiltfile 1. Helm Charts Purpose: This directory stores all Helm charts -whether first-party or third-party dependencies -that form the foundation of your Kubernetes services. Workflow: Render: Helm charts are templated to disk. Include in Kustomize: You use Kustomize to ingest those templates. Manage with Helmfile: Helmfile can orchestrate multiple Helm releases, ensuring everything is installed/updated consistently. This approach decouples the raw Helm charts from the environment-specific overlays, making it easier to plug them into different clusters in a standardized way.\n2. Components Purpose: Store Kubernetes manifests that are not part of Helm charts. This could include CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions), operator manifests, or any other resources you want to keep separate. Usage: Directly reference these components in your cluster definitions or in a higher-level grouping concept (more on that next). 3. Groups Purpose: Group related services and configurations together under a single overlay. For example, a monitoring group might include Prometheus, Grafana, and other supporting components. Hierarchy: Groups can reference other groups, enabling layering. A dev group might inherit from a default group, adding environment-specific patches for development clusters (e.g., less resource allocation, debug logging). 4. Clusters Purpose: Each cluster folder describes exactly what should be running on that cluster, pulling in components and groups as needed. Structure: Each cluster has its own folder, which Flux (or another GitOps tool like Argo CD) monitors. Subfolders often map to namespaces or functional areas. Environment-specific customisations, such as image overrides or domain-specific settings, also live here. Benefits: This design ensures that each cluster references only the resources it needs, with any environment-specific overrides captured in a single place. 5. src (Git Submodules) Purpose: Each application or service your team develops has its own dedicated repo, added to this GitOps repo as a submodule. Motivation: Separating source code lifecycles from infrastructure while still keeping them in close proximity. Each service can evolve at its own pace (with separate versioning and pull requests). When you’re ready to deploy, you update references in the GitOps repo to point to the correct version or commit. 6. Tilt for Local Development Tiltfile: A single Tiltfile at the root of your GitOps repo configures local Kubernetes development using Tilt and k3d. Realtime Feedback: Tilt builds Docker images locally as you code and pushes them into your k3d cluster. You can check out feature branches across multiple submodules and test them all together in a local environment. Developer Happiness: This local dev approach drastically shortens the feedback loop, letting you iterate faster than if you had to push and wait for a remote pipeline to run. CI/CD Flow Now that we’ve broken down the structure, let’s see how changes flow from a developer’s pull request to a cluster.\n1. Pull Request → Image Build Trigger: A developer creates or updates a pull request in the src project repository. Automation: A CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) builds a Docker image for the new code. 2. CI Environment Setup in Dev Cluster The pipeline references the GitOps repo (specifically the Dev cluster folder). A CI folder under that Dev cluster is used to stand up a temporary environment for tests. This CI folder typically isn’t referenced by the main Dev cluster overlay, so it doesn’t affect production-like resources. The pipeline applies a Kustomization overlay that includes the new Docker image (and possibly “latest” versions of other services). 3. Readiness \u0026amp; Integration Tests Wait for Ready: The pipeline checks that all pods in the CI environment reach a “Ready” state. Integration Tests: Another folder within the CI path (e.g., integration-test) includes job manifests that run your test suite. The pipeline applies these manifests, waits for the jobs to complete, then collects logs/results. 4. Cleanup Once tests finish, the pipeline tears down the temporary namespace to keep clusters clean. If tests pass, the pipeline can merge the pull request or notify that the new image is ready for promotion. Key Benefits Modular \u0026amp; Extensible: By separating Helm charts, components, groups, and clusters, you can easily add new resources or reuse existing ones. Consistent Environments: Groups let you define and share sets of configurations across multiple stages (e.g., dev, staging, prod). Automated Testing: The CI process ensures each new feature or fix is validated in an ephemeral environment, mirroring production as closely as you need. Local Development: Tilt and k3d let you replicate the cluster environment on your machine, enabling quicker feedback loops and more productive debugging. Auditability \u0026amp; Traceability: Since every change is committed to Git, you get a clear history of who changed what and when. The Single Pane of Glass Beyond the technical benefits, this pattern fundamentally changes how teams collaborate.\nOne entry point, any role. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a backend engineer, frontend dev, SRE, or even a PM wanting to understand the system - you clone one repo and run tilt up. Within minutes you have a working https://localhost.company.co/ with the entire stack running locally.\nCross-functional debugging. I\u0026rsquo;ve watched frontend engineers fix backend bugs by running grep -r \u0026quot;error message\u0026quot; from the repo root. The pseudo mono-repo structure means the answer is always somewhere in your checkout - you just need to find it.\nNo onboarding tax. Switching teams doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean spending a week setting up a new development environment. The same tilt up command works whether you\u0026rsquo;re on payments, auth, or the data pipeline.\nDeclarative infrastructure as documentation. New joiners can understand the entire system topology by reading the clusters/ and groups/ directories. The infrastructure is the documentation.\nConclusion Adopting GitOps with a well-thought-out repository structure can dramatically simplify your Kubernetes workflows. By combining Helm, Helmfile, Kustomize, and tools like Flux or Argo CD, you can create modular, scalable, and testable deployments. And with a local development pipeline powered by Tilt and k3d, you can iterate quickly without sacrificing best practices.\nIf you’re looking for a GitOps pattern that balances clarity, flexibility, and collaboration, give this structure a try. You’ll enjoy:\nFewer manual steps. A predictable CI process. An environment that’s friendly for both new and experienced team members. Ready to dive deeper? Experiment with a small cluster or side project first. Once you’re comfortable with the structure, scale it up to your full production workloads.

How can Git be the source of truth if there are extra steps between merge and understanding impact?\nIn this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to generate manifest diffs during PR review, so reviewers see exactly what will change in the cluster before they approve.\nThe Problem Consider the typical Argo CD diff plugin workflow:\nDeveloper creates PR Reviewer approves (without seeing cluster impact) Code merges Now you see the diff of what will change Sync happens The diff comes too late. The reviewer has already approved. If something looks wrong, you need another PR to fix it.\nGitOps should mean: what\u0026rsquo;s in Git is what\u0026rsquo;s in the cluster. Reviewers should understand the full impact before approving.\nThe Solution Generate diffs at PR time by:\nBuilding manifests from the main branch Building manifests from the PR branch Diffing the two Posting the result as an artifact or comment This way, reviewers see the actual Kubernetes resources that will change - deployments, services, configmaps, everything.\nKey Principle: Absorb Your Helm Charts Before we can diff manifests, we need actual manifests to diff. If you\u0026rsquo;re deploying Helm charts directly via helm install, you don\u0026rsquo;t have rendered manifests in Git.\nInstead, absorb them:\nhelm template my-release my-chart \\ --namespace my-namespace \\ \u0026gt; components/my-service/manifests.yaml Or better, use Helmfile to declaratively manage this:\n# helmfile.yaml - keep charts vanilla, use inline values only releases: - name: prometheus namespace: monitoring chart: prometheus-community/prometheus version: 25.0.0 # Minimal inline values - external values files don\u0026#39;t work with template Then render to disk:\nhelmfile template \u0026gt; components/monitoring/prometheus.yaml Important: Keep absorbed charts as vanilla as possible. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to configure everything via Helm values. Instead, push customisation to Kustomize overlays where changes are visible and diffable:\n# groups/monitoring/kustomization.yaml resources: - ../../components/monitoring/prometheus.yaml patches: - patch: |- - op: replace path: /spec/replicas value: 3 target: kind: Deployment name: prometheus-server This separation means:\nComponents: Vanilla absorbed charts (rarely change) Groups/Clusters: Environment-specific patches (visible in diffs) Building and Diffing The core CI logic is straightforward:\n# Build manifests from main branch git checkout origin/main kustomize build clusters/prod \u0026gt; /tmp/main-manifests.yaml # Build manifests from PR branch git checkout $PR_BRANCH kustomize build clusters/prod \u0026gt; /tmp/pr-manifests.yaml # Generate diff diff -u /tmp/main-manifests.yaml /tmp/pr-manifests.yaml \u0026gt; diff.txt For multiple clusters or kustomization roots, iterate:\nfor root in clusters/*/; do cluster=$(basename $root) kustomize build $root \u0026gt; /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml # ... diff each done GitLab CI Example generate-diffs: rules: - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID changes: - deployments/**/* script: | # Fetch main branch git fetch origin main # Build main branch manifests git checkout origin/main for root in clusters/*/; do cluster=$(basename $root) kustomize build $root \u0026gt; /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml done # Build PR branch manifests git checkout $CI_COMMIT_SHA for root in clusters/*/; do cluster=$(basename $root) kustomize build $root \u0026gt; /tmp/pr-$cluster.yaml diff -u /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml /tmp/pr-$cluster.yaml \u0026gt; diffs/$cluster.diff || true done artifacts: paths: - diffs/ when: always GitHub Actions Example name: Generate Manifest Diffs on: pull_request: paths: - \u0026#39;clusters/**\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;components/**\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;groups/**\u0026#39; jobs: diff: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: fetch-depth: 0 - name: Setup Kustomize uses: imranismail/setup-kustomize@v2 - name: Generate diffs run: | mkdir -p diffs for root in clusters/*/; do cluster=$(basename $root) # Build from main git checkout origin/main kustomize build $root \u0026gt; /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml 2\u0026gt;/dev/null || echo \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml # Build from PR git checkout ${{ github.sha }} kustomize build $root \u0026gt; /tmp/pr-$cluster.yaml # Diff diff -u /tmp/main-$cluster.yaml /tmp/pr-$cluster.yaml \u0026gt; diffs/$cluster.diff || true done - name: Upload diffs uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 with: name: manifest-diffs path: diffs/ - name: Comment on PR uses: actions/github-script@v7 with: script: | const fs = require(\u0026#39;fs\u0026#39;); const diffs = fs.readdirSync(\u0026#39;diffs\u0026#39;); let comment = \u0026#39;## Manifest Diffs\\n\\n\u0026#39;; for (const file of diffs) { const content = fs.readFileSync(`diffs/${file}`, \u0026#39;utf8\u0026#39;); if (content.trim()) { comment += `\u0026lt;details\u0026gt;\u0026lt;summary\u0026gt;${file}\u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt;\\n\\n\\`\\`\\`diff\\n${content}\\n\\`\\`\\`\\n\u0026lt;/details\u0026gt;\\n\\n`; } } github.rest.issues.createComment({ owner: context.repo.owner, repo: context.repo.repo, issue_number: context.issue.number, body: comment }); Finding Kustomization Roots In simple setups (one kustomization per cluster), iterating clusters/*/ works fine. But in more complex setups with nested kustomizations, groups referencing groups, and shared components, you need to find the roots - kustomizations that aren\u0026rsquo;t referenced by any other kustomization.\nThe algorithm:\nWalk all kustomization.yaml files, mark each as a potential root For each one, look at its resources and bases Any kustomization that\u0026rsquo;s referenced by another gets marked as NOT a root What remains are true roots Here\u0026rsquo;s a bash implementation:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash # find-kustomize-roots.sh - Find kustomizations not referenced by others declare -A is_root # Find all kustomization.yaml files and mark as potential roots while IFS= read -r kfile; do is_root[\u0026#34;$kfile\u0026#34;]=1 done \u0026lt; \u0026lt;(find . -name \u0026#34;kustomization.yaml\u0026#34;) # For each kustomization, mark its references as non-roots for kfile in \u0026#34;${!is_root[@]}\u0026#34;; do dir=$(dirname \u0026#34;$kfile\u0026#34;) # Extract resources and bases from the kustomization refs=$(yq -r \u0026#39;(.resources // []) + (.bases // []) | .[]\u0026#39; \u0026#34;$kfile\u0026#34; 2\u0026gt;/dev/null) for ref in $refs; do # Resolve the referenced kustomization path ref_kustomize=$(realpath -m \u0026#34;$dir/$ref/kustomization.yaml\u0026#34; 2\u0026gt;/dev/null) ref_kustomize=\u0026#34;.${ref_kustomize#$(pwd)}\u0026#34; if [[ -f \u0026#34;$ref_kustomize\u0026#34; ]]; then is_root[\u0026#34;$ref_kustomize\u0026#34;]=0 fi done done # Output only the roots for kfile in \u0026#34;${!is_root[@]}\u0026#34;; do if [[ \u0026#34;${is_root[$kfile]}\u0026#34; == \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; ]]; then echo \u0026#34;$kfile\u0026#34; fi done Now your diff script becomes:\n# Build and diff only root kustomizations for root in $(./find-kustomize-roots.sh); do root_dir=$(dirname \u0026#34;$root\u0026#34;) name=$(echo \u0026#34;$root_dir\u0026#34; | tr \u0026#39;/\u0026#39; \u0026#39;-\u0026#39;) git checkout origin/main kustomize build \u0026#34;$root_dir\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /tmp/main-$name.yaml git checkout $PR_BRANCH kustomize build \u0026#34;$root_dir\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /tmp/pr-$name.yaml diff -u /tmp/main-$name.yaml /tmp/pr-$name.yaml \u0026gt; diffs/$name.diff || true done This ensures you diff what actually gets deployed, not intermediate layers that are only used as building blocks.\nMaking It Visual Plain diffs work, but an HTML visualization makes review easier:\nTree view of changed files/resources Side-by-side comparison Kubernetes metadata (kind, namespace, name) Collapsible sections for large changes You can build this with Go templates, React, or even a simple script that wraps diff2html.\nKey Benefits No Surprises: Reviewers see exactly what will change before approving Git Is Truth: The merged state is the deployed state - no extra steps Faster Reviews: Clear diffs mean faster, more confident approvals Catch Mistakes Early: Spot accidental changes (wrong image tag, missing resource limits) before they hit the cluster Audit Trail: Diffs become part of the PR history Conclusion Showing diffs at deployment time is too late. By the time you see the impact, the code is already merged. True GitOps means understanding the full impact during review.\nThe pattern is simple:\nAbsorb Helm charts into your repo as vanilla rendered manifests Kustomize via Kustomize overlays (not Helm values) Build kustomize roots for both branches Diff and present to reviewers Review with full knowledge of cluster impact This approach has saved me countless \u0026ldquo;oops\u0026rdquo; moments and makes PR reviews genuinely meaningful for infrastructure changes.\nFurther Reading\nPractical GitOps Pattern - Repository structure and workflow Kustomize Helmfile diff2html - For visual diff rendering ","date":"January 14, 2025","hero":"/posts/gitops-pr-diffs/hero.png","permalink":"/posts/gitops-pr-diffs/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\nA common pattern I see promoted is using tools that show you what will change in your cluster \u003cem\u003eat sync time\u003c/em\u003e - after your code is already merged.
