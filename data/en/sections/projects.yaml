    summary: Multi-tenant Kubernetes-based SaaS platform for home battery optimization, serving paying customers in production.
    tags: ["professional", "side-project"]
    description: |
      Architected and developed the complete SaaS infrastructure and frontend for a home battery optimization
      platform. Built a production-ready multi-tenant system that enables customers to optimize their battery
      storage by integrating with multiple UK energy providers and inverter types.

      **My Technical Contributions:**
      - Multi-tenant Kubernetes deployment on Civo cloud with per-customer namespace isolation
      - GitOps workflow using Flux and Kustomize for automated deployments
      - React + TypeScript dashboard with real-time WebSocket data visualization (Recharts)
      - Supabase integration for authentication and data management
      - Terraform infrastructure as code for reproducible environments
      - Paddle payment integration for subscription management
      - Grafana Alloy for monitoring and observability
      - Integration with UK energy provider APIs (Octopus Energy, So Energy, EDF, E.ON)

      **Key Achievements:**
      - Architected and deployed production SaaS infrastructure serving paying customers
      - Built 8-wave progressive rollout system for safe feature deployment
      - Delivered 838+ commits across infrastructure and frontend repositories
