    I have no hesitation in recommending Mark.
    From the moment he joined the fully remote development team he was both popular and productive.
    He is delivery focused and very much a team player; working well with all parts of the organisation.
    Whilst Mark's Golang knowledge was already impressive he showed an aptitude and willingness to learn new skills and
    fully understand the development environment. For example, he was pivotal in implementing Kubernetes; researching
    options, presenting his findings and proving his hypotheseis, carving the way forward. Mark is generous with his
    knowledge and able to work with all levels of the business as well as the technical teams. He quickly understands
    business concepts and requirements and can translate those into tasks. He helped implement Agile in parts of the
    organisation that were still using Waterfall methodology. As his development manager I appreciated that Mark could
    be trusted to own an issue through to resolution, that he would help mentor other members of the team, be happy and
    confident in offering his knowledge whilst listening and learning.

    Mark is an extremely competent software engineer with a vast understanding of software engineering patterns and
    approaches. During my time working with him I was amazed by the number of technical experiments he has piloted,
    a testament to his commitment to go above and beyond what is required of him.
