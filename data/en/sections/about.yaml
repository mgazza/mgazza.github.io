# a summary about you
summary: |
  With over 15 years of hands-on experience in software engineering,
  I specialize in building cloud-native platforms with expertise spanning
  the full stack - from Kubernetes operators and GitOps infrastructure to
  modern React frontends.

  Currently a Lead Software Engineer at Vitrifi (telecoms/network sector),
  I architect and deliver production systems across distributed teams.
  As an entrepreneur, I architected PredBat Cloud, a complete multi-tenant
  SaaS platform that runs the open-source PredBat home battery optimisation
  software, serving paying customers and integrating with UK energy providers.

  I drive technical strategy, mentor teams, and deliver production-ready
  systems. I'm passionate about building platforms that solve real-world
  problems, whether in telecoms, energy, or beyond.
