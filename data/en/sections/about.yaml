# a summary about you
summary: |
  Lead Software Engineer with 16+ years of progressive experience architecting and
  delivering cloud-native platforms, distributed systems, and DevOps infrastructure.
  Specialist in Kubernetes, Golang, and Platform Engineering with proven ability to
  lead teams, mentor engineers, and drive technical strategy across telecoms, energy,
  and fintech sectors.

  Currently at Vitrifi (telecoms/network), I architect distributed systems for
  multi-region network infrastructure. Key achievements include designing and
  implementing a CRDT-based datastore for network state synchronisation using
  distributed consensus algorithms, improving system availability through
  conflict-free replication across multiple regions, building 5+ production-grade
  Kubernetes operators, and establishing GitOps infrastructure serving as single
  source of truth for production deployments.

  Technical expertise spans: Platform Engineering, SRE practices, Kubernetes,
  Golang, Python, TypeScript/React, multi-cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP/OCI), Infrastructure
  as Code (Terraform), GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux), distributed systems (CRDT, consensus
  algorithms, state synchronisation), cryptographic systems, and observability
  (Prometheus/Grafana).

  Outside of work, I've architected two production SaaS platforms - including a
  multi-tenant energy management platform reaching paying customers within 4 months,
  demonstrating end-to-end delivery capability from infrastructure to frontend.

  I drive technical strategy, mentor cross-functional teams, and deliver production-ready
  systems at scale. I excel in building reliable, scalable cloud-native infrastructure
  and thrive in environments where I can leverage my expertise to solve complex technical
  challenges.
