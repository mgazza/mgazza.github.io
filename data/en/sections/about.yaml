# a summary about you
summary: |
  With over 15 years of hands-on experience in software engineering,
  I specialise in building cloud-native platforms with expertise spanning
  the full stack - from Kubernetes operators and GitOps infrastructure to
  modern React frontends.

  Currently a Lead Software Engineer at Vitrifi (telecoms/network sector),
  I architect distributed systems for multi-region network infrastructure.
  I've designed and implemented CRDT-based datastores for network state
  synchronisation, built multiple Kubernetes operators for service lifecycle
  management, and established GitOps workflows that serve as the single source
  of truth for production deployments.

  Outside of work, I've architected two production SaaS platforms as technical
  projects - one reaching paying customers within 4 months - demonstrating my
  ability to deliver complete solutions from infrastructure to frontend.

  I drive technical strategy, mentor teams, and deliver production-ready
  systems at scale. I'm passionate about building platforms that solve
  real-world problems, whether in telecoms, energy, fintech, or beyond.
