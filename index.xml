The response was great, but the most common question was: &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;How do I actually run this thing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fair question. The BNG repo has a Dockerfile and some example configs, but spinning up a distributed system with multiple components, observability, and realistic test traffic isn&amp;rsquo;t trivial. That&amp;rsquo;s the hard part of infrastructure - not writing the code, but figuring out how to deploy it, test it, and debug it when things break.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Killing the ISP Appliance: An eBPF/XDP Approach to Distributed BNG</title><link>/posts/ebpf-bng/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ebpf-bng/</guid><description>&lt;p>I used to work for an ISP startup that was building next-generation infrastructure. The company didn&amp;rsquo;t make it, but the problems we were trying to solve stuck with me. So I spent a few weeks building what we never got to: an open-source, eBPF-accelerated BNG that runs directly on OLT hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post explains the architecture and why I think it&amp;rsquo;s the future of ISP edge infrastructure.&lt;/p>

If you’ve spent any time working with Kubernetes, you’ve probably heard of &lt;em>GitOps&lt;/em> -a methodology that treats Git as the source of truth for defining and operating infrastructure and applications. In this post, I’ll walk you through a GitOps setup that uses a hierarchical folder structure, combining Helm, Helmfile, and Kustomize to give you robust, testable, and scalable deployments. We’ll also see how tools like Flux and Tilt fit into the workflow, enabling both automated deployments and seamless local development.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GitOps PR Diffs: Review What You Deploy</title><link>/posts/gitops-pr-diffs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/gitops-pr-diffs/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction&lt;/strong>
A common pattern I see promoted is using tools that show you what will change in your cluster &lt;em>at sync time&lt;/em> - after your code is already merged. In my view, this is already too late and goes against GitOps principles. How can Git be the source of truth if there are extra steps between merge and understanding impact?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to generate manifest diffs &lt;em>during PR review&lt;/em>, so reviewers see exactly what will change in the cluster before they approve.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using socat to backdoor via kubernetes</title><link>/posts/socat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 09:02:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/socat/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes when you&amp;rsquo;re developing or debugging locally you need access to resources that are exposed to your cluster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically, most organisations use VPN&amp;rsquo;s to enable you to access these resources, but there&amp;rsquo;s a much easier way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="socat">Socat.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The alpine/socat image is perfect for enabling backdoor access to private or internal services that are available to
your cluster without having to set up and manage VPN&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How it works is pretty simple. We run a socat pod exposing a service that&amp;rsquo;s viewable by the pod but not by us.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
