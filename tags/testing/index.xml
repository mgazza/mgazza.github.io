The response was better than I expected — the post hit 94 points on Hacker News and sparked some good discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also sparked some fair criticism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One commenter called the code &amp;ldquo;vibe coded.&amp;rdquo; Another wrote a detailed comment about why distributed BNG has never achieved commercial success, despite attempts by Cisco, Metaswitch, and others. Someone asked about CPU-to-NPU bandwidth in whitebox OLTs. Someone else pointed to 6WIND&amp;rsquo;s commercial DPDK-based BNG as a more production-ready alternative.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
