The response was better than I expected — the post hit 94 points on Hacker News and sparked some good discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also sparked some fair criticism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One commenter called the code &amp;ldquo;vibe coded.&amp;rdquo; Another wrote a detailed comment about why distributed BNG has never achieved commercial success, despite attempts by Cisco, Metaswitch, and others. Someone asked about CPU-to-NPU bandwidth in whitebox OLTs. Someone else pointed to 6WIND&amp;rsquo;s commercial DPDK-based BNG as a more production-ready alternative.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Killing the ISP Appliance: An eBPF/XDP Approach to Distributed BNG</title><link>/posts/ebpf-bng/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ebpf-bng/</guid><description>&lt;p>I used to work for an ISP startup that was building next-generation infrastructure. The company didn&amp;rsquo;t make it, but the problems we were trying to solve stuck with me. So I spent a few weeks building what we never got to: an open-source, eBPF-accelerated BNG that runs directly on OLT hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post explains the architecture and why I think it&amp;rsquo;s the future of ISP edge infrastructure.&lt;/p>
