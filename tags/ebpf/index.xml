Experience Did.</title><link>/posts/ai-assisted-engineering/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ai-assisted-engineering/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I &lt;a href="/posts/ebpf-bng/">open-sourced the eBPF BNG&lt;/a> last month, someone on Hacker News called it &amp;ldquo;vibe coded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I understand why. The project moved fast — a working distributed BNG with eBPF/XDP packet processing, DHCP, RADIUS, NAT, PPPoE, BGP, and a coordination service, all open-sourced within weeks. That&amp;rsquo;s suspicious. When something appears quickly, people assume it was thrown together quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But speed of implementation isn&amp;rsquo;t the same as absence of design. And using AI tools to write code isn&amp;rsquo;t the same as letting AI design your system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unglamorous Work: Hardening an eBPF BNG for Production</title><link>/posts/ebpf-bng-production/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ebpf-bng-production/</guid><description>&lt;p>A month ago I wrote about &lt;a href="/posts/ebpf-bng/">building an eBPF-accelerated BNG&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="/posts/ebpf-bng-infra/">infrastructure repo&lt;/a> that lets you run it locally. The response was better than I expected — the post hit 94 points on Hacker News and sparked some good discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also sparked some fair criticism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One commenter called the code &amp;ldquo;vibe coded.&amp;rdquo; Another wrote a detailed comment about why distributed BNG has never achieved commercial success, despite attempts by Cisco, Metaswitch, and others. Someone asked about CPU-to-NPU bandwidth in whitebox OLTs. Someone else pointed to 6WIND&amp;rsquo;s commercial DPDK-based BNG as a more production-ready alternative.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Zero to eBPF BNG in 15 Minutes: The GitOps Deployment Repo</title><link>/posts/ebpf-bng-infra/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ebpf-bng-infra/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I &lt;a href="/posts/ebpf-bng/">open-sourced the eBPF BNG&lt;/a> itself. The response was great, but the most common question was: &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;How do I actually run this thing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fair question. The BNG repo has a Dockerfile and some example configs, but spinning up a distributed system with multiple components, observability, and realistic test traffic isn&amp;rsquo;t trivial. That&amp;rsquo;s the hard part of infrastructure - not writing the code, but figuring out how to deploy it, test it, and debug it when things break.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Killing the ISP Appliance: An eBPF/XDP Approach to Distributed BNG</title><link>/posts/ebpf-bng/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ebpf-bng/</guid><description>&lt;p>I used to work for an ISP startup that was building next-generation infrastructure. The company didn&amp;rsquo;t make it, but the problems we were trying to solve stuck with me. So I spent a few weeks building what we never got to: an open-source, eBPF-accelerated BNG that runs directly on OLT hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post explains the architecture and why I think it&amp;rsquo;s the future of ISP edge infrastructure.&lt;/p>
