The response was great, but the most common question was: &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;How do I actually run this thing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fair question. The BNG repo has a Dockerfile and some example configs, but spinning up a distributed system with multiple components, observability, and realistic test traffic isn&amp;rsquo;t trivial. That&amp;rsquo;s the hard part of infrastructure - not writing the code, but figuring out how to deploy it, test it, and debug it when things break.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Killing the ISP Appliance: An eBPF/XDP Approach to Distributed BNG</title><link>/posts/ebpf-bng/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ebpf-bng/</guid><description>&lt;p>I used to work for an ISP startup that was building next-generation infrastructure. The company didn&amp;rsquo;t make it, but the problems we were trying to solve stuck with me. So I spent a few weeks building what we never got to: an open-source, eBPF-accelerated BNG that runs directly on OLT hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post explains the architecture and why I think it&amp;rsquo;s the future of ISP edge infrastructure.&lt;/p>
