Experience Did.</title><link>/posts/ai-assisted-engineering/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ai-assisted-engineering/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I &lt;a href="/posts/ebpf-bng/">open-sourced the eBPF BNG&lt;/a> last month, someone on Hacker News called it &amp;ldquo;vibe coded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I understand why. The project moved fast — a working distributed BNG with eBPF/XDP packet processing, DHCP, RADIUS, NAT, PPPoE, BGP, and a coordination service, all open-sourced within weeks. That&amp;rsquo;s suspicious. When something appears quickly, people assume it was thrown together quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But speed of implementation isn&amp;rsquo;t the same as absence of design. And using AI tools to write code isn&amp;rsquo;t the same as letting AI design your system.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
