The Interview The system design question was straightforward: “Design a system that displays the top 5 songs currently being played in real-time across our streaming platform.”

</code></pre><p><strong>Key design decisions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>State-based tracking</strong> (not time windows): Track who is currently playing what, with 1-hour TTL</li><li><strong>Shard by user_id</strong> (not song_id): Avoids hot partitions from viral songs</li><li><strong>Gossip membership</strong>: Automatic failure detection and self-healing</li><li><strong>Optimistic locking</strong>: Prevents race conditions on cache updates</li><li><strong>Multi-layer caching</strong>: Redis + HTTP + client-side</li></ul><p>During the interview, I noticed the interviewer seemed surprised by several concepts. They asked clarifying questions about hash rings, seemed unfamiliar with optimistic locking patterns, and appeared genuinely interested when I mentioned HTTP caching strategies - as if this was new information rather than standard practice.</p><h2 id=the-feedback>The Feedback</h2><p>A few days later, I received the rejection:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;They reached a basic workable system design, although it was difficult to maintain shared understanding with the candidate. They repeatedly used buzzwords/terminology without stopping to check in with the interviewer to ensure they were following/understood.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Here&rsquo;s what stopped me: <strong>Hash rings, gossip protocols, optimistic locking, and thundering herd aren&rsquo;t buzzwords.</strong> They&rsquo;re fundamental distributed systems concepts that any senior engineer working on distributed systems should recognize, even if they don&rsquo;t use them daily.</p><p>These terms exist because they describe specific, well-understood technical problems and solutions:</p><ul><li><strong>Hash ring</strong> = consistent hashing for distributed key-value storage</li><li><strong>Gossip protocol</strong> = decentralized membership and failure detection</li><li><strong>Optimistic locking</strong> = conflict resolution without blocking</li><li><strong>Thundering herd</strong> = cache stampede problem when many clients simultaneously request cold cache data</li></ul><p>Using the correct terminology isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;buzzwords&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s being precise.</p><h2 id=the-real-problem-leveling-mismatch>The Real Problem: Leveling Mismatch</h2><p>The feedback framed the interviewer&rsquo;s knowledge gaps as my communication failure. But here&rsquo;s the thing - I wasn&rsquo;t throwing around trendy terms to sound impressive. I was describing actual implementation patterns that would be necessary for the system they asked me to design.</p><p>Later, I learned the interviewer had 7 years at the company working on payment systems (BACS, Faster Payments, Mastercard integration). These are complex systems, but they hadn&rsquo;t worked with modern distributed systems architecture patterns. Kubernetes made them uncomfortable, and concepts like gossip protocols, hash rings, and optimistic locking weren&rsquo;t part of their domain experience.</p><p><strong>This wasn&rsquo;t a communication problem. It was a leveling problem.</strong></p><p>The company was hiring for a staff-level distributed systems role, but sent an engineer whose domain experience was in payment systems integration to evaluate distributed systems architecture. The interviewer couldn&rsquo;t distinguish between legitimate technical depth and &ldquo;buzzwords&rdquo; because they lacked the context to evaluate either.</p><h2 id=the-ego-red-flag>The &ldquo;Ego&rdquo; Red Flag</h2><p>The feedback also mentioned:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whilst the behavioural persuasion example was okay, they mentioned the main obstacle to others being persuaded of his point of view was their egos, which was a bit of a red flag.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The question was: &ldquo;Tell me about a time you&rsquo;ve convinced others about something technical. How did you approach it?&rdquo;</p><p>I talked about introducing GitOps patterns (mono-repo, submodules) to teams that had been working in silos. My answer was:</p><p>&ldquo;Most people are hesitant at first - it seems like a lot when you&rsquo;ve been siloed for a long time. But I explain how it breaks down walls between departments because everyone can see and work on all the code. Even if you don&rsquo;t need to touch other team&rsquo;s code, it helps with communication and understanding. <strong>99% of people love it once they see the benefits.</strong> But there&rsquo;s always that 1% - the ones you couldn&rsquo;t convince to write unit tests or follow SOLID principles either. Usually it&rsquo;s ego - the &lsquo;rockstar developer&rsquo; types who think best practices don&rsquo;t apply to them.&rdquo;</p><p>I was describing the <strong>1% of engineers who resist all best practices</strong>, not saying &ldquo;everyone who disagreed with me had an ego problem.&rdquo;</p><p>But in an interview where the interviewer was already feeling technically out of their depth, that answer probably landed as: &ldquo;This person thinks they&rsquo;re smarter than everyone else and dismisses people who don&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;</p><p>Context matters. Even a reasonable answer can sound arrogant when the interviewer is already defensive.</p><h2 id=what-i-learned>What I Learned</h2><p><strong>1. Interview leveling matters both ways</strong></p><p>Companies need to ensure interviewers can actually evaluate the level they&rsquo;re hiring for. A mid-level engineer shouldn&rsquo;t be the primary technical evaluator for a staff-level distributed systems role - not because they&rsquo;re not smart, but because they literally can&rsquo;t distinguish signal from noise at that level.</p><p><strong>2. &ldquo;Buzzwords&rdquo; is sometimes code for &ldquo;concepts I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;</strong></p><p>When feedback says you &ldquo;used buzzwords,&rdquo; ask yourself: Were you actually using jargon unnecessarily, or were you using precise technical terminology that the interviewer wasn&rsquo;t familiar with? There&rsquo;s a meaningful difference.</p><p><strong>3. Calibrate to your audience - even in interviews</strong></p><p>I could have probed more during the interview: &ldquo;Are you familiar with hash ring sharding? Let me explain how it works&mldr;&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s a delicate dance - you don&rsquo;t want to sound condescending, and in a high-stakes interview, you&rsquo;re trying to demonstrate competence, not teach concepts.</p><p><strong>4. Word choice matters in behavioral questions</strong></p><p>Saying &ldquo;their egos got in the way&rdquo; is different from saying &ldquo;there was initial resistance to changing direction, but once we did a proof-of-concept, everyone aligned.&rdquo; Same situation, drastically different framing.</p><h2 id=the-unexpected-twist>The Unexpected Twist</h2><p>Oh, and there was one more thing: The recruiter also flagged that the interviewer was &ldquo;95% confident I was drinking beer&rdquo; during the 9am Tuesday video call.</p><p>I was drinking Robinsons summer fruits squash (pink liquid) in a Beavertown-branded pint glass that was a Christmas present.</p><p>I sent a polite clarification email immediately. The recruiter responded the following afternoon confirming HR had checked with the interviewer - it didn&rsquo;t affect the decision. I&rsquo;d already failed on technical &ldquo;communication&rdquo; grounds (the &ldquo;buzzwords&rdquo; feedback).</p><p>But it&rsquo;s a useful reminder that video interview optics matter, even when you&rsquo;re just trying to stay hydrated with pink squash at 9am on a Tuesday.</p><h2 id=the-good-rejection>The Good Rejection</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: <strong>This was a good rejection for both of us.</strong></p><p>If their senior engineers don&rsquo;t regularly use distributed systems concepts like hash rings and gossip protocols, then my experience wouldn&rsquo;t have been valued there anyway. I would have been frustrated, they would have been frustrated, and we&rsquo;d both be worse off.</p><p>The feedback about &ldquo;buzzwords&rdquo; told me everything I needed to know about the technical depth of the role and the team I&rsquo;d be joining.</p><h2 id=for-other-candidates>For Other Candidates</h2><p>If you get feedback that you &ldquo;used too many buzzwords&rdquo; or &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t explain concepts clearly,&rdquo; consider:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Were you actually using jargon unnecessarily?</strong> Sometimes we do get carried away with terminology when simpler language would suffice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Or were you using precise technical language that the interviewer wasn&rsquo;t familiar with?</strong> In which case, the leveling might not be right for that role.</p></li><li><p><strong>Did you probe for understanding during the interview?</strong> I could have checked in more often with &ldquo;Does that make sense?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are you familiar with this pattern?&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><strong>Is this a role where your depth would be valued?</strong> If they&rsquo;re calling fundamental distributed systems concepts &ldquo;buzzwords,&rdquo; they might not be working on the kinds of problems you want to solve.</p></li></ol><h2 id=for-hiring-companies>For Hiring Companies</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re hiring for senior/staff level distributed systems roles:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Ensure your interviewers can evaluate at that level.</strong> Don&rsquo;t send someone who primarily works on monoliths to evaluate distributed systems expertise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Train interviewers to distinguish between buzzwords and technical depth.</strong> &ldquo;Eventual consistency&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a buzzword when you&rsquo;re literally designing an eventually-consistent system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Calibrate your leveling expectations.</strong> If your team doesn&rsquo;t regularly use concepts like hash rings, CRDTs, or consensus protocols, you might not actually need staff-level distributed systems expertise - and that&rsquo;s fine! Just don&rsquo;t interview as if you do.</p></li></ol><hr><p><strong>Have you experienced interview leveling mismatches?</strong> I&rsquo;d love to hear your stories - both as a candidate and as an interviewer. What are the signs that an interviewer can&rsquo;t evaluate the level they&rsquo;re hiring for?</p><p><em>Update: I&rsquo;m currently exploring roles where distributed systems depth is actually valued.
